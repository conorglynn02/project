        <h3>Design Ideas</h3>
        
        
        <br>
        <p><em>Pattern</em><br><br>
          As you can see in the image at the top of the page, I have named some of my design ideas 
          for this dash-cam concept. I chose the two patterns for the dash-cam's surface. One was 
          the Arsenal 2020/21 home kit style while the other was the Arsenal 2020/21 away kit style. 
          For reference, you can see both of these designs next to the actual product below. I used 
          the home kit pattern for the two legs of the dash-cam while I used the away kit for the 
          cone of the cannon. See below Arsenal jersey designs on left with actual dash-cam with 
          designs on right. (Note: pattern on cone is hard to see because of strong artificial 
          lighting in the render studio.)

          <em>Wheel Zoom</em><br><br>
          Even when considering a wheel's natural tendency to roll, I still wanted to include the 
          wheel as it is a big part of Arsenal's crest and an 18th century cannon's functionality. 
          I came up with the idea to have the wheel locked into place so it wouldn't roll off the 
          dashboard or out of line of the road. After thinking about it for a little bit, I figured 
          out a way to stop the rolling while also letting the wheel serve a purpose. I came to the 
          conclusion of having the wheels decently resistant to any rotation so normal movement of 
          the car wont spin the wheels in any way. However if a human tries to spin the wheel, it 
          will click into the next groove and it will either zoom in or out depending on which way 
          it was rotated. The centre of the wheel also is used as a power on/off switch too. See 
          product wheel on left.

          <em>Solar Panels</em><br><br>
          This dash-cam doesn't need any wires because this dash-cam is completely powered by solar 
          panels. By day, this dash-cam charges up its large lithium-ion battery to be used later. 
          In the day it also uses the sun's energy to completely run the dash-cam while still charging 
          the battery. Even when not in use, the dash-cam can recharge its battery to full capacity. 
          By night, the lithium-ion battery kicks in and uses the sun's stored energy to run. This 
          format makes the dash-cam run completely on clean, green, renewable energy which is completely 
          free. I think there would be more public support for an idea that is environmentally friendly 
          so would increase sales. <br><br>

        <h4>Sponsors</h4>
        <p>The main sponsors of Arsenal F.C. are Fly Emirates, Adidas and Visit Rwanda. These partners 
          give massive amounts of financial funding to Arsenal F.C. while in exchange getting different 
          types of perks. For Fly Emirates and Visit Rwanda, both of these pay tens of millions per year 
          to be featured on the jersey. With Fly Emirates 'donating' more money than Visit Rwanda, they 
          are the main sponsor of Arsenal. They appear on the front of the jersey and they are also given 
          the name of Arsenal's stadium, Emirates Stadium. Visit Rwanda name is located on the sleeve of 
          the jersey and also as sponsorship in the stadium. Adidas has a different type of sponsorship 
          deal with Arsenal than the others. Adidas is the highest paid sponsor of Arsenal currently. On 
          the other side of the coin, Adidas recieves the lion's share of the money spent on jersey sales. 
          This makes Adidas profit for their investment and Arsenal gets a fraction of the profit.<br>
