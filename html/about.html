        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <br>
        <p>Hello, my name is Conor Glynn and I am 19 years old. I just finished my 
            Leaving Cert exams a few months ago in June 2021. I went to school in 
            St. Jarlath’s College, Tuam where I studied eight subjects. These include 
            the core subjects (English, Irish and Maths), three science subjects; 
            biology, chemistry and physics along with applied maths and DCG. My 
            favourite subject in school was definately DCG as I feel that is where I 
            could show off my ideas and creativity. I was recognised for my high 
            academic achievement in the Leaving Certificate where I was in the top 5% 
            of results in the country. I was awarded for receiving amongst the highest 
            Leaving Cert points in my school.</p>
          <br>
          <p>
            I am the youngest of four and the son of two extremely hard-working parents. 
            My Dad is a part-time farmer and window-fitter. My Mom is a factory worker. 
            I aspire to be as hard-working and caring as they are.
          </p>
        <br>
        <p>I took a gap year before deciding to go to university. I took this 
        gap year because I wanted to explore my options for the future and what my 
        interests are. During my year away from secondary education, I learned that 
        I really enjoy creating things and technology really peaks my interest. I 
        created this website as a challenge for myself and also to help my father 
        who helps me everyday without hesitation.</p>
