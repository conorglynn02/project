        <h3>Planning</h3>
        <br>
        <h4>Introduction</h4>
        <p>To decide which idea would be the best idea for my portfolio, I came up 
        with a number of ideas and I picked the idea which was the most suitable in 
        my opinion.</p>
        <br>
        <h4>1. Arsenal Badge Design</h4>
        <p>My first idea was to create a dash-cam which is in the shape of Arsenal’s 
        crest. The lens can be seen as the axle of the cannon's wheel. The opposite 
        side of the dash-cam shows a large screen which has the shape of the badge, 
        with plenty of room to capture and show the full accident in the event of a 
        crash. It would be fixed in the car by a suction cup windscreen mount. The 
        colour scheme would resemble the official badge.</p>
        <br>
        <p><img src="../Images/screen.png" align="right" hspace="40" vspace="35" width="400"/>
            <em>Pros:</em><br> 
            &bull; There is a large screen for viewing, meaning more action can be seen 
            than a regular smaller screen. <br><br>
            &bull; The iconic badge can be clearly seen with this design, therefore it 
            is definitely intended for the target audience.
        </p>
            <br>  
        <p><em>Cons:</em><br> 
            &bull; One of the main purposes of a dash-cam is to be hidden from other's 
            view. As a result of this, having a screen forces the dash-cam to be larger 
            than ones without a screen and so it couldn’t be a very discreet dash-cam. 
            This could make it a target for theft.<br><br>
            &bull; A big screen could possibly distract the driver while driving. This is 
            potentially very dangerous and could place lives in danger if it is too much 
            of a distraction.<br><br>
            &bull; This dash-cam could also increase the driver’s blind spots as it is 
            too big than non-screen dash-cams.
            </p>

                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;
                &emsp;Sketches I drew
            </p>
            <br>
        <h4>2. Soccer Ball Design</h4>
        <p>
            Another seperate idea I had was to base a dash-cam off an Arsenal themed soccer 
            ball. My inspiration for this was a soccer ball that I saw on the 
            <a href="https://arsenaldirect.arsenal.com/Football-Shirts-and-Kit/Accessories/
            Arsenal-20-21-Football-Size-5/p/AFT9092">Official Arsenal FC Online Store</a>. 
            I decided to add a camera sticking out of the ball so the video could be caught 
            with as little disruption to the ball as possible. There is o creen on the ball 
            as I wanted to keep with the ball theme as much as I possibly could. It would be 
            rested the dashboard but it might be feasible for it to be mounted with a mount 
            however it could interfere with the camera.
        </p>
            <br>    
        <p><img src="../Images/ball.png" align="right" hspace="40" vspace="35" width="350px" />
            <em>Pros:</em><br>
            &bull; The lack of screen would allow the dash-cam to be small as modern 
            technology allows it to be maybe the size of a tennis ball. As a result of this, 
            it would attract minimal amount of attention from any thief passing by.<br><br>
        </p>
            <br>
        <p><em>Cons:</em><br>
            &bull; The circular design makes it unsuitable to be placed on the dashboard of a 
            car because of the expected rocking motion of the car.<br><br>
            &bull; Even taking into consideration its colour scheme, this ball design isn’t 
            really associated with Arsenal FC. This would make it harder to market to 
            consumers who are looking for a classic themed Arsenal dash-cam.

        <br>
        <h4>3. Cannon Dash-cam Design</h4>
        <p>
            My final idea was to make a dash-cam based on the traditional 18th century cannon which is 
            featured on the arsenal crest. This cannon will sit on the dashboard. This will have Wi-Fi 
            and Bluetooth adaptability so it will not need a screen as it can display the images to your 
            phone in real time. The camera would be displayed through the open end of the cannon. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p><img src="../Images/cannon1.png" align="right" hspace="40" vspace="40" width="450px" />
            <em>Pros:</em><br>
            &bull; I decided for this design to remove the screen from this dash-cam. As a 
            result of this, it can remain smaller inside a car and is therefore less obvious 
            to thieves.<br><br>
            &bull; I think that the use of solar panels is clever because no wires are needed to 
            power this dash-cam.<br><br>
            &bull; By looking at this design you can clearly see that it is richly associated with 
            the intended theme and therefore it is a great choice for the target market.
          </p>
            <br>
          <p><em>Cons:</em><br>
            &bull; The wheels may allow it to roll however I resolved that they could be locked 
            into place in the final design process.<br><br> 
          </p>
